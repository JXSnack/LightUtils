# LightUtils
Fork of *Chimerabot's Waypoints* | Sort of Chimerabot's Waypoints Reborn

LightUtils is **NOT** *Chimerabot's Waypoints*. This is a fork that uses the code of *Chimerabot's Waypoints*, but not a version where new features for waypoints are added.

**This version is still in development. We're still working on more features. If you find issues, don't mind to report them!**

# What's different to Chimerabot's Waypoints?
- Added comments for better code reading
- Added confetti
- Added sparklers
- Added firework
- Added config
- Enable/Disable Micropoints
- It's a LIGHT SYSTEM!!!

# Important infos
**DO NOT IMPORT THE NORMAL *CHIMERABOT'S WAYPOINTS*. LightUtils ALREADY BRINGS ITS OWN *CHIMERABOT'S WAYPOINTS***

Get all items: `/function snackbag:give/all`

Get seperate items: `/function snackbag:give/<item>`

Enable sparklers: `/function snackbag:config/enable_sparklers`* Disable: `/function snackbag:config/disable_sparklers`*
